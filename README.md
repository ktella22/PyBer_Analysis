# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
This project helps to understand how to convert csv files to DataFrame and use the data from DataFrame to create visualization using Matplotlib. The purpose of this Module challenge is to create a ride-sharing data by city type to filter the number of rides and fares based on the date of the month so that company can make better decision to improve changes to meet the goal profits based on the performance of each city type in ride-sharing experience.     

## Results
According to pyber summary DataFrame, there are difference in fares, total drivers availabe and number of rides based on different city type. In Urban area, the city is poupulated that the total number of rides are the highest amoung the other city type which directly affects the total drivers, total fares and the average of fare and drivers per individual ride. However, the average fares per ride and per drivers increases as the city becomes further away from the urban city area and total number of drivers and rides decreases in remote areas. It explained that the lower number of drivers leads to higher costs of fares for each rides in rural and suburban areas.

## Summary
We know that the number of drivers impacts directly to the cost of fares for rides. The average fare per ride is higher when there are less drivers. The company should modify the ride share prices by controlling or improving the driver availbiltiy in specific time to meet company targeted goals.  

In April month, the total fares seems to increase in Suburban city while there is a decrease in total fares in other city type. The company should do reseach the causes of the increase in suburban area so that they can do changes in other city areas. 

In summary table, the average fare per ride has linear increasing trend based on the type of city. However, there is a drastic inrease in average fare per driver where the average fare per driver in rural area are 2.5 times more than urban city. It shows that the total drivers in remote areas are a lot lower than in the city. The company may want to provide more number of drivers in remote areas to enhance its profits.
